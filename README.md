# Christmas Lights

This is my implementation of the Christmas Lights App from [Florin Pop's App Ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas).

Animations for the lights are made with [react-spring](https://www.react-spring.io)

## Features

- Play/Pause animation
- Change number of rows (up to 7 max)
- Change between 8 animation patterns
